## 🔐 How to Stay Safe

- Always verify emails and links before clicking.  
- Don’t share sensitive data over the phone or chat.  
- Use MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) wherever possible.  
- Stay skeptical — if something feels off, it probably is.  
- Report suspicious behavior to your IT/security team.

## 🎯 Why It Matters

Understanding social engineering is critical because it targets human vulnerabilities — no firewall can stop an employee from clicking a malicious link if they’re not educated.
